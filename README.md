# PHP SCAD

SCAD means SuperCAscaDing ;). This is just historical old code by
me I did to go around limitations in PHP. I never used it productive
and cause of I never do PHP again (without being paid lots of money),
I thought i can publish it here for other PHP dudes, so that they
can shot themself in the foot ;).

# What it does

Please see the output of the test.php to understand what it does. It
combines several classes to a so called Hive that then can be outputted
to a file for being used as "overclass".
